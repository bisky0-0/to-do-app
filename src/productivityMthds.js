    new MethodObj('1. Plan Your Day Ahead of Time', `The first step to being productive is planning a day's schedule in advance.
    You should know what you're doing, when you're doing it, and how long on any given day. Without a schedule, you're likely to miss out on important tasks. \n \n 
    Write down a detailed plan of the day early morning or the night before. Write everything you need to do so that you have a sense of direction and know what to focus on next.
    This eliminates all guesswork, and there's less chance of you drifting away and wasting time because you do not know what you'll do next.  `),

    new MethodObj('2. Write Down the Three Most Important Daily Tasks ', `Jot down the three most important tasks for the day. Describe the tasks in detail 
    to avoid any ambiguity. Focus on important tasks rather than urgent ones. `),

    new MethodObj(`3. Use Any Productivity Technique`, `Supercharge your productivity by using a productivity method. An incredibly powerful productivity 
    tool can you stay focused during work time. A productivity system will help you manage your day by setting accomplishable goals. Select a productivity method 
    that is right for you that helps you increase your daily output.`),

    new MethodObj(`4. Set a Single Goal for Each Day`, `Set a single goal for each working day so you can focus on individual tasks. A good idea can be breaking down daily goals
    into multiple tasks, where you'll only tend to that particular task in the allotted time`),

    new MethodObj(`5. Set Specific Times to Check Email`, `Email checking accounts for one of the main distractions that wastes valuable time during the workday. Choose two times
    a day for checking emails, preferably before lunch and before finishing the day's work.`),

    new MethodObj(`6. Learn to Say “No”`, `Saying no can be hard for some, but if you want to boost your productivity, you can't allow others to order you around every now and then. `),
    new MethodObj(`7. Use Website Blockers`, `Use website blockers to stop distracting websites from popping up in the middle of your work.`),
    new MethodObj(`8. Use red and blue colors more often`, `Remove clutter from your desk. Studies suggest that red and blue colors improve brain performance, with red known to increase 
    attention to details while blue sparks creativity. Surround your workplace with these colors to enhance productivity. `),

    new MethodObj(`9. Two-Minute Rule for Small Tasks`, `Do not waste time deciding whether you should do small tasks that keep cropping up throughout your day. Instead, ask yourself if you 
    can complete the task in 2 minutes or less – if yes, go ahead with the task. If not, add the task to your to-do list for later.`),

    new MethodObj(`10. Listen to Productive Music`, `Music is an excellent therapy to help maintain focus and stay productive. Choose music that enables you to focus on the task at hand.`),
    new MethodObj(`11. Use Templates for Regular Tasks`, `Create templates for routine tasks that are created the same way every time. This will save you a lot of time and increase your 
    overall productivity.`),

    new MethodObj(`12. Group Similar Tasks`, `Batch similar tasks so you can complete them with the same frame of mind. This will make your work process flow smoothly and help you do more in less time.`),
    new MethodObj(`13. Avoid Multitasking`, `It might be tempting to do two things simultaneously, but multitasking does more harm than good. Research shows that about 98% of people are less
     productive when they multitask as they are not focusing on a single task.`),

    new MethodObj(`14. Use an Important/Urgent Matrix for Decision Making`, `An effective time management tool called Important/Urgent Matrix or Eisenhower Matrix helps prioritize tasks on the basis
     of how important or urgent they are. The matrix divides tasks into four different quadrants - Important & Urgent, Important & not urgent, Not important & urgent, Not important & not urgent. This
     method ensures you spend your time effectively as well as efficiently. `),

    new MethodObj(`15. Start Your Day With a Tough or Easy Task`, `The way you start your day dictates the flow of the rest of the day. You can either start by doing the most demanding task first,
     so everything else feels more effortless, or do the easiest thing first to gain valuable momentum.`),

    new MethodObj(`16. Use the “One and Done” Rule`, `Most of us tend to keep some tasks aside, thinking of taking care of those tasks later. But rarely do we actually do those later because we won't 
    add them to our to-do- lists. To avoid this, add each new task to a to-do list, so there's no risk of forgetting later.`),

    new MethodObj(`17. Take Regular Breaks`, `Breaks give your mind a much-needed chance to recover from intense focus, but you must maximize the benefit of breaks. Zone out completely or meditate
     during breaks to relax your mind and body.`),

    new MethodObj(`18. Create a Break Agenda`, `List everything you want to do on your break and squeeze these between work time. This will help accomplish tasks efficiently during work time. Thus,
     you'll wisely use your break time to do things you enjoy. `),

    new MethodObj(`19. Work in Short Bursts`, `The human mind can concentrate on the same thing for a short span. So, it makes sense to work in short bursts like the Pomodoro technique, where you 
    work in 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks in between. This helps motivate you to complete tasks in a short time.`),

    new MethodObj(`20. Create a Dedicated Workspace`, `If you are working from home or remotely, create a dedicated workspace where you'll go to work and leave once you're finished.`),
    new MethodObj(`21. Work Near Natural Light`, `A simple productivity hack is to create your workspace near natural light. Exposure to sunlight is believed to improve sleep, thereby contributing
     to your well-being and productivity levels.`),

    new MethodObj(`22. Eliminate Possible Distractions`, `It's easy to give in to distractions, but you must find ways to avoid distractions while working. Distractions cause a lot of wasted time 
    trying to regain focus on the task. Getting rid of distractions can result in more productive work being done in lesser time.`),

    new MethodObj(`23. Break Down Your Goals`, `Instead of procrastinating on your far-fetched ultimate goals, break down the goals into smaller, more attainable goals that seem more realistic.
     These goals should be easy to accomplish and fit into your schedule.`),

    new MethodObj(`24. Take Time to Reattach Yourself to Work Every Morning`, `Once you're finished with the day's work, you probably try to detach from work. Take a few minutes in the morning to 
    reattach yourself to work by thinking about what you achieved the day before or what you hope to accomplish during the given day.`),

    new MethodObj(`25. Wake Up Early`, `This can give you a great head start on any working day because you feel entirely re-energized at the beginning of a day. You can get a lot of work done early
     in the morning when there are fewer distractions than at midday`),

    new MethodObj(`26. Make Sure Every Task Is Related to a Goal`, `Before taking up a task, make sure it is related to a long-term goal like one of your SMART goals. If the task is unrelated to your
     advancement, either eliminate it or assign it to someone else`),

    new MethodObj(`27. Follow Deadlines`, `Regardless of how long you have to complete a task, make sure you do it in the given amount of time. Your productivity will improve if you know a deadline is
     approaching.`),

    new MethodObj(`28. Schedule Time for Self-Care`, `Schedule self-care activities to recharge yourself to prevent burnout from work pressure. It could be anything that helps you relax and unwind — 
    leisurely reading on your favorite couch, a relaxing bedtime ritual, a 10-minute walk, meditating, painting, or anything else. `),

    new MethodObj(`29. Let Go of Perfectionism`, `Nothing is perfect, so don't waste time trying to make every task perfect. If the work is good enough, move on to the next thing.`),
    new MethodObj(`30. Identify the ‘Why’ Behind Your Job`, `Ask yourself why you chose to go into the field that you did. Make sure to keep those reasons in your mind while working so you stay
     motivated to be productive and successful in your job.`)
